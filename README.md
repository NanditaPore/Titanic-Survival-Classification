# Titanic-Survival-Classification
Titanic Classification : Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.

Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction

Description:
This repository contains a data science project that focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic during the tragic disaster. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare the data for machine learning.
Model Building: Utilize a Random Forest Classifier to train the prediction model on the labeled training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics and generate a confusion matrix for validation.
Visualization: Explore survival trends based on different factors using interactive and informative plots.
Predictions: Generate predictions for the test dataset and save the results in an Excel file.
Insights: Gain valuable insights into the factors that might have influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
Download the 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' datasets and place them in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, and generate predictions.
Explore the visualizations to gain insights into the survival patterns based on various factors.
Dependencies:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
IPython (for the FileLink in Jupyter Notebook)
Note:
This project serves as a practical demonstration of data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning, and visualization techniques. It aims to provide an educational resource for those interested in data science and predictive analytics.
